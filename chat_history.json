Store as stages[stageIndex].levels[levelIndex] with word, theme, and scramble.\r\n\r\nEach stage has a new theme (e.g. Animals, Food, Space, Sports, Mythology, etc). Themes cycle through stages.\r\n\r\nWords get longer and harder by stage.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Gameplay Flow\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShow: Current Stage, Level, Theme.\r\n\r\nDisplay scrambled letters of the current word.\r\n\r\nUser types guess into text box.\r\n\r\nIf correct \u2192 show \u201cCorrect!\u201d, add points (base 10 \u00d7 stage number). Move to next level.\r\n\r\nIf wrong \u2192 show \u201cTry again.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Points System\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTrack total points with useState + persist in local storage.\r\n\r\n+Points for correct answers.\r\n\r\nSpend points on:\r\n\r\nHint = 50 pts \u2192 reveal 1 correct letter in position.\r\n\r\nAnswer = 200 pts \u2192 reveal full word.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf not enough points, show \u201cNot enough points.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n4. Hints/Answers\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nButton: \u201cHint (50 pts)\u201d \u2192 deduct 50 points, reveal letter.\r\n\r\nButton: \u201cAnswer (200 pts)\u201d \u2192 deduct 200 points, reveal whole word and mark as completed.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. Progression\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen level cleared, move to next.\r\n\r\nAfter 15 levels \u2192 advance stage, increase difficulty.\r\n\r\nDifficulty: word length increases, scramble complexity increases.\r\n\r\n\r\n6.
