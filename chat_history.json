Implement a \"Try again\" message for wrong answers.\n2.  **Streak Bonus:** Add a streak bonus system that awards +5 points every 3 correct answers in a row.\n3.  **Hints/Answers:** Implement \"Hint\" and \"Answer\" buttons. Deduct 50 points for a hint (reveal a letter) and 200 points for the answer (reveal the full word).
